# crowdBit

### Crowsourcing data made simple.

crowdBit is a platform that users all over the world can contribute to new and existing datasets by uploading their own files. Those files will be validated through a machine learning model (Clarifai) to determine accuracy. Complete, validated datasets can then be nicely downlaoded in zip format.

### Set-up
```
npm install
npm start
```

### Improvement plan
- Switch from converting files back and forth into base64 format, just dump the files in AWS or GCP
- Support for other file types
- Implement web interface and make PWA
- Make native Android and iOS support
